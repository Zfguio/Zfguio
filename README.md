## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about building practical and creative solutions using both programming and 3D tools.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm currently diving deep into:

- C# with .NET technologies — focusing on desktop, web, and backend development

- Database integration — working mostly with local setups like MySQL/XAMPP

- Blender & Unreal Engine — learning 3D modeling and game development workflows

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm developing a lightweight, offline-first task management system, similar to Jira, built entirely for solo developers and small teams. The goal is to make it cross-platform: desktop, mobile, and web — all running locally without cloud dependencies. It’s an ambitious challenge, but I’m learning a lot along the way.

## 🤝 I'm Open To Collaborations In

- C# / .NET projects

- C++ or Unreal Engine game dev

- Blender 3D assets
